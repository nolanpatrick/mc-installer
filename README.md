# mc-installer
<p>This is a Bash script to automate the installation of the popular game Minecraft on (rpm-based) Linux distributions for which there is no official binary available.
A version for Debian-based distros is coming soon (dependencies cause issues with the script as-is).</p>

Tested and working on the following distributions:
<ul>
<li>Fedora 32</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04 (with modifications)</li>
</ul>
